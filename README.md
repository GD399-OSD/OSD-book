# OSD-book

An Open Book?

A book of writings, experiments, ideas, outcomes, and thoughts from our term spent investigating and participating in the intersection of open source and designing.

Don't forget to add your own folder to the book repo: 
https://github.com/GD399-OSD/OSD-book

Please copy the StartingPlace.sla into your new folder (name your folder w/ your name or your section's title) and then rename StartingPlace.sla something intelligent too — again, yourName.sla or yourSectionsTitle.sla 

Any images, text files, etc. that you need for your section, keep in your folder!

For your actual projects (like all the files for doing your project itself, not for your chapter about your project) please also create a new Repo for all of that... Like gefang should put his processing sketches in a repo, john and chris both have made repos for their fonts, pragun should make a repo of nodebox experiments (or add to mine) — make sense???

## Constraints:

- French fold, 5.5in w x 8.5in h (half letter)

- Must include your section title and page numbers in common placement as specified in starting doc.
- Create a form for your section that tries to visualize the contents and meaning of your experiments, thoughts, etc.
