# F/LOSS Regularly

Free/Libre Open Source software (F/LOSS) powers much of the web and the modern tech world. How do we put the same ideas and mechanisms towards the benefit of Graphic Design? Contemporary designers interface with open source through web technologies and frameworks, maybe an operating system -- Facebook React, Adobe Brackets and Phone Gap, Bootstrap, Google Android (and a lot of non-open things are built on top of open things Safari, Dropbox, etc). It's also likely that you've seen or used an open source font (The IBM Plex typeface got some press; fonts.google.com makes F/LOS type viewable on millions of websites across the internet (Open Sans is featured in more than 19,000,000 websites)). But, despite most of the internet being powered by open source tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Node.js, PHP, Drupal, etc.), and that web designers increasingly rely on F/LOS frameworks, text editors, fonts, and file formats to do their work, visual design has yet to embrace tools nor methodologies available to it. F/LOS in graphic design furnishes different ideological framing for the creation of cultural artifacts (Free as in Freedom, increased collaboration, community). Engaging in making with the tools, formats, and ideas creates new opportunities for learning and creating. Through these lenses F/LOS is a useful critical tool for the discipline.

## A Starting place

"Why have developers latched onto the open source movement, but designers have not?" -- Garth Braithwaite

A web search for "Open Source Design" returns an easy place to start understanding how F/LOS can have an impact in graphic design. Garth Braithwaite, a designer at Adobe (originally for the open source text editor Brackets, now on some other open source projects still within Adobe), founded an organization called "Design Open" (originally named Open Source Design [DATES!]) Braithwaite's founding manifesto is:

I will:

- find opportunities to design in the open
- share my design experiences; both the good and the bad
- find time for meaningful projects
- openly participate in design discussions
- work with other designers by choice
- improve my toolbox

[Open Source Design Manifesto]

With the _Open Design Manifesto_, and a subsequent 2013 talk called "Designers Can Open Source,"[cite treehouse?] Braithwaite explores simple actions for designers to immediately become more "open." This revolves around an increase in general sharing: "Sharing process, especially the failures, really helps" and "post as you are working, show how things evolve." This (hopefully) creates a new kind of design ecosystem where designers are much friendlier and collaborative with their neighbors -- more un-self-concious.

What might help with unselfconcious sharing? Braithwaite points to two tools available to open source software: git and github. Why don't we try to use the same tools if possible? Git is a version control language ... github is about sharing and forking and mergeing ... its also about discussion and building a community around apiece of software or code. Github might be hard and unintuitive for a designer, but, dribbble was designed for designers! Braithwaite mentions a feature of dribbble: the rebound! something that actually invites the taking something and visually riffing, adding, or remixing to be shared again. This is often what designer's are not doing: un self conciously "rebounding" each other's work. Sadly, while the discussions that evolve in a github repo are often in order to solve problems associated with that code. The conversations that evolve on a dribbble are often just cursory accolades.

Braithwaite tells us that designers should be more transparent in how we work, we should share more, and he starts to scratch the surface -- but does he give us enough to start? what about the tools? are there other ideas and tools that would be effective in accelerating this? Where did the sharing ecosystem present in Open Source software come from?

## How Bazaar

Braithwaite in his sharing ideas summarizes and recontextualizes analysis done by Eric Raymond in _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_. Raymond explains how the process and systems for designing and building the linux kernel created our current systems for what open source is: a distributed community collectively engaging in a tool's advancement. Linus Torvalds, the original programmer behind the linux kernel, practiced several (novel at the time), techniques in sharing and building the Linux codebase.

In _TCATB_ Raymond outlines and explains nineteen points key to linux's and Linus's successes. There are two in particular that better actualize Braithwaite's sentiments.

## Release Early, Release often

As soon as a semi-functioning version of Linux was working, it would be posted for others to use. This "release early, release often" maxim flew in the face of existing software development practice at the time (early 90's). One did not want to release buggy code, it was feared that the users would abandon your project. Raymond found that this was not the case with Linux. "[I]t was clear that something different and much healthier was going on [with Linux]." The success was in how Torvalds was treating his users, and in who his users were. Braithwaite's points draw from Torvalds and Raymond: sharing successes and failures as visual learning opportunities aligns with releasing early and often and allowing your users to help find and fix issues.

## Linus's law

The biggest breakthrough Raymond points too in the form of a "rule" has come to be known as "Linus's Law." Linus's law (cite raymond + the wikipedia page?) states that "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone," or "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." Basically, get as many useful users as you can to look at and tinker with your stuff.

The early Linux ecosystem was a pool of sharing developers. Updates were released and distributed early and often. People using these early release tools were the same set of people equipped to find problems with the tools and, this is key, actually do something about those problems! By sharing rapidly and without self-conciousness (you couldn't be too self-concious, your changes might make it back to everyone!), Linux improved rapidly and robustly. [citeable?] The project maintained a prescise vision from Torvalds, he was the end decider of what made it into the official linux realease at the end of each day or cycle, but the community would debate best options, offer multiple solutions, and if necessary, go off into their own direction if an impasse was met. (This is part of why there are so many flavors of GNU/Linux today -- if an uncrossable technical or philosophical chasm is met, sometimes groups fissure and two projects are born from one.)[list of linux flavors?]

Raymond's analysis is supported with his own experiments utilizing the same techniques of continuous release and community aided bug finding and fixing (he built an email program using the same methodologies pulled from Linux). Contemporary open source communities utilize most if not all of these practices.

How does a designer do this? A tool like Dribbble or Behance allows for the seeing each other's design, maybe tinkering a little bit, maybe conversing about what is working or not, but does it offer the robustness required to the visual design equivalent of a Linux community? Serious, respected designers AREN'T on these platforms. In contemporary design these "bazaar's" aren't deemed the place to put ones professional or competent work, they are seen as places for students, noobs, etc. For Linux and other open programs, the distribution servers ARE where the good, successful people are hanging out and pinning up their work for lack of a better metaphor. All this sharing back and forth, community bug fixing, iterating and evolving, this did still sound familiar. Where has this existed in designing before?

## Spectacular Vernacular

Linus's Law & Raymond's other explanations on the linux community bug finding and solving sounds a lot like other, older forms of cultural production. The release early and release often maxim, as well as the "many eyes make light problem solving," mirror older, vernacular processes.

Stewart Brand's _How Buildings Learn_ dissects vernacular building and describes a process that predates the Linux community, yet sounds uncannily similar. In Brand's view, the vernacular process (which he synonymosly refers to as "adaptive building") is a systematic framework for evolving concepts. A culture steadily culminates these frameworks over time. Traditions subsequently arise allowing vernacular designers to reuse the invented forms and methods for common, everyday tasks. Contemporary design typically looks for new or unique solution to a given problem, which is counter-productive to creating traditions.

Vernacular in this context means common designs by common people. What makes cultural common-ness special is its ability to evolve over time (and fairly easy replication ability). Common features survive the passage of time when they are generally understood as "good." Over years, the vernacular incorporates more and more "good" features while eradicating "bad" ones.

To illustrate this in his book, Brand references the Cape Cod house, and includes a wonderful diagram called "The Evolution Chart of the Siasconset Whale House." The diagram visually shows what Raymond is trying to explain to us in _TCATB_, that simple things released into the wild of a user community will grow, evolve, and change -- but will come back with improvements. The improvements are merged into the computer code or architectural language, then you repeat.

If software can be designed and constructed this way, and vernacular objects evolve this way, why not contemporary visual design?

Visual designers can always pile new ideas on top of old ones. We do not have to reinvent the wheel each time we tackle a problem. Ideas imported from elsewhere, if better at solving problems than our current ideas, are easy to incorporate (exactly how present-day open-source communities function). Our role must be to take the cautious, evolving methodology of vernacular design and apply it alongside our contemporary technologist tendencies and conceptual processes. Wisdom _with_ speed...

It's really how we've been designing our entire human existence. how can designers recapture this? Taking what was done and changing it subtly has been the normal means of cultural production until recently. If our design forbearers could create houses, chairs, clothes, tea kettles, broadsides, tapestries, etc. this way, surely new cultural agents today can find useful ways to collectively create?

Raymond's analysis of his own project present two other keys to Linux's success. One was fast friendly distribution over the internet, where all the variations, versions, and updates to Linux could live together and be (relatively easily) accessed. As contemporary designers one has ample access to the internet. There is no shortage of bandwidht and opportunites for sharing/distributing one's work.

Version control: Without any way to track and merge changes this crowd enabled designing isn't very possible. Linus also invented git, a way to track and coordinate files among many users. There are starting to be some much easier to understand visual editors for git workflows. This should start to aid designers in getting into version control as well.

Braithwaite proposes that designers start using github. Open design is not so open that it is design by committee. Be clear that it is collaborating, not codesigning.

Raymond and Braithwaite are both clear that successful open source things need singular visions and strong leaders.

If cultural artifacts were historically created this way, what happened? why did we stop? is it really just the markets fault? capitalism??? What other values of critical views might we find through our exploring?

Raymond tells everyone the above version of the Linux story. Raymond's points seem to inspire a lot of people and he then goes onto found the open source foundation and works through the rest of the 90s and early 2000s encouraging tech and communities at large to take advantage of open source ideas. Hurray open source wins (wired article? <https://www.wired.com/2016/08/open-source-won-now/>) now what? That part of the story only covers the Open Source part of F/LOS.

- sharing and transparency is importnat
- community building (& documentation?)
- asking community for feedback is Useful
- those things are aided by the Internet
- you need some good tools.......

But what got us to Open Source in the first place? Brand's vernacular is a a good way of helping undestand this in a more designerly way. The ideas behind open and vernacular point out that all creative efforts worked using communal sourcing of success metrics in the past. Why does Brand see vernacular methods at doibng so many things so well?

## Free as in Freedom

"Free software" and "open source" describe the same category of software, more or less, but say different things about the software, and about values. The GNU Project continues to use the term "free software", to express the idea that freedom, not just technology, is important. [^About The Gnu Project- <https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html>]

The origins of F/LOS are in a critical vein. Stallman's creation of GNU is a critique of what mainstream, proprietary software was turning into at the time. Stallman was writing computer code in the time where the vernacular models were being pushed out by proprietary models of culture creation. Specifically, proprietary computer code.

Stallman's point of view is idealistic. If we take this ethical point of departure to think about why open source tools for design where does that lead us?[^GNU manifesto] (more history here???).

From _The GNU Project_:

A program is free software, for you, a particular user, if:

- You have the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs. (To make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is exceedingly difficult.)
- You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for a fee.
- You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.

The term "free software" is sometimes misunderstood -- it has nothing to do with price. It is about freedom.

Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby posit in _Designer As Author_ that designers should increasingly consider "alternative visions to those put forward by industry." F/LOS presents real opportunities for doing this. Stallman's framing of GNU _is exactly_ this -- GNU is _not_ what the mainstream software is doing. By being free as in freedom, Stallman has created opposition to proprietary, closed-ness that clearly states what is perceived as wrong. By using F/LOS software, not just the concepts or ideals, one immediately engages in a critical design exercise. Inkscape, Linux, Scribus, etc. are _not_ what the design industry is using. These not only provide alternative softwares that can be critical of "affirmative" designs tools like Adobe Creative Cloud or Autodesk's suite of programs, but they also come from a differing set of ideological places. The politics of the systems value freedom over saleable value. Does this become the most important aspect of F/LOS?

The marketplace actually looks semi-favourably on "Open Source." but, that terminology was specifics created to get the marketplace to look favorably on OS. Stallman has no interest or concern whether the marketplace is into Free software.

If proprietary tools create problematic ethical scenarios, then F/LOS utopian thinking is ripe for using critically. The tools themselves are downloadable and accessed by anyone with an internet connection and semi-modern computer running Linux, Windows or OSX (well, in theory, maybe not fully in practice). So, these are not extreme in and of themselves -- the tools are realistic while the ideals are extreme. Seen this way F/LOS fulfills a different set of Dunne and Raby's ideas -- it can become a design fiction. Presenting an alternative, albeit fictional present to provoke designers into questioning their tools, ethics, and ...

That places us in an interesting place -- using Free/Libre/Open Source as a way critique the current design industry. One that is a monoculture of operating system, software, and aesthetics. A Wall of aluminum with glowing fruits, and a certain creative cloud being where everyone's inspirations and tools for output now live.

Designer David Rudnick points out that designing is increasingly focused on solving problems of a client, not problems of an audience.[^Strelka talk, Twitter?] Embracing F/LOS(S) is one way aaround this. Rudnick asks if we are serving the audience or the clients. In his best version of design, the audience is who matters. A client should be hiring you to help them help their audience, not just help them period. This aligns w/ stallman's view of the user and software.

## Free doesn't mean easy

So we have on one hand a pragmatic approach that is based in the history of designing, the history of just how we as humans created cultural and societal artifacts, and on the other a critical design approach that intentionally positions itself as different from mainstream capitalist designing.

So there is a spectrum of making that falls into "F/LOS designing." If you are on the critical design fence, then moving whole heartedly to all F/LOS replacements for the normal tools of a designer is required. It becomes almost a performance piece to intentionally point out the moderno-capitalist mono culture the F/LOS stance (again in Stallman-esque, Critical design-esque extreme terms) is in opposition too.

- How does all of this fit together?
- What's the take away as designers? (ideals/tools/reuse/access/transparency/etc.?)?

There are barriers to doing this as a visual designer. The main one is by choosing openness, transparency, and sharing you are working in a way that is at odds w/ much of how corporate design wants us to behave.

License stuff?

## Be the Designer with a bigger toolbox

An advanatage to F/LOS tools is that since they use file types that are built on open standards, and that are often just specialty versions of XML files, they are just text files! they can relaly easily be tracked and shared with tools that make a workflow of collaborating, sharing, etc. easy.

Advantage to F/LOS ideals in creating oppositional model useful for critiquing our mainstream culture. By choosing to use this surreal set of softwares (linux, scribus etc.) a designer is specifically saying "I am not using the same comptuer or software as you."

In terms of sharability.

Is it important that the source is shareable or is it important that the spirit is embraced? F/LOS delivers uses file formats that are easier to port across a range of systems and tools (SVG, XML). What do you see out there when you look for open source design? Fonts, Icons, Templates, Frameworks. Is this what F/LOS design means? Is that all that's possible? We get the internet, we've got version control, we're into the mindset of transparent and sharing, etc. Is that enogh? how does that make design/designing better? what does that do other than help on individual, creative levels?
