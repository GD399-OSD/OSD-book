# F/LOS Regularly

Free/Libre Open Source Software has a wide reach. Open operating systems power servers and computers and open programs and modules run websites and applications we rely on daily. Open Source has even extended into the corporate sector (at least start up wise) -- Facebook React[^], Adobe Brackets[^] and Phone Gap[^], the IBM Plex typeface[^], many of the underlying technologies to Dropbox[^], etc. -- But, despite most of the internet (and increasingly enterprise backends) running on open source tools (Linux, Apache, Node, PHP, React, etc.) visual design has yet to fully embrace these tools and ideas. What does visual design gain (or preserve?) by not dipping its toes into free/libre/open source? What can we bring to graphic design from F/LOS communities?
