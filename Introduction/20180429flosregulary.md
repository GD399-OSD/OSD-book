# F/LOS Regularly

- some setup
- define f/los & a brief history lesson?
- GNU = idealism; so move into critical design?
- As a counter, TCATB defines a process from Linux, this is practical/pragmatic. Fits w/ Brand's vernacular designing to compare a computer process to a more traditional design process.
- How does all of this fit together?
- What's the take away as designers? (ideals/tools/reuse/access/transparency/etc.?)?

Free/Libre Open Source Software has a wide reach. Open operating systems power servers and computers and open programs and modules run websites and applications we rely on daily. Open Source has even extended into the corporate sector (at least start up wise) -- Facebook React[^], Adobe Brackets[^] and Phone Gap[^], the IBM Plex typeface[^], many of the underlying technologies to Dropbox[^], etc. -- But, despite most of the internet (and increasingly enterprise backends) running on open source tools (Linux, Apache, Node, PHP, React, etc.) visual design has yet to fully embrace these tools and ideas. What does visual design gain (or preserve?) by not dipping its toes into free/libre/open source? What can we bring to graphic design from F/LOS communities?

Open source software powers much of the web and the modern tech world. Open source hardware powers all manner of maker spaces, workshops and offices. How do we use these same ideas and mechanisms to the benefit of Graphic Design?

Tracing the lineage of "Open Source" one is led back to Richard Stallman's GNU Manifesto [@fat's talk][@garth DB's talk][TCATB by eric raymond too]

Stallman's point of view is idealistic. If we take this ethical point of departure to think about why open source tools for design where does that lead us?

Dunne and Raby.

Rudnick line?

Utopianism...

Okay, well, that places us in an interesting place -- using Free/Libre/Open Source as a way to create a "fiction" with which to critque the current design industry. One that is a monoculture of operating system, software, and aesthetics. A Wall of aluminum with glowing fuits, and a certain creative cloud being where everyone's inspirations and tools for output now live. Mr. Keedy also talks about the "global style"...

But is there something more useful than just critical opposition to be found in open source?

Raymond and the cathedral and the bazaar

in analyzing linux creation, basically describes the vernacular process.

How buildings learn from each other?

If open source is really the new vernacular, then something like this: "It is absurdly arrogant to begin the design process with an empty piece of paper"[^]- Hella Jongerius & Louise Schouwenberg (<https://www.readingdesign.org/beyond-the-new>) makes so much sense!

It's really how we've been designing our entire human existence. how can designers recapture this???

Open design / garthDB?

okay! so now how to wrap this up???

How to integrate the making into this???
