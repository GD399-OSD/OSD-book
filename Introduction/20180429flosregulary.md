# F/LOS Regularly

- some setup
- define f/los & a brief history lesson?
- GNU = idealism; so move into critical design?
- As a counter, TCATB defines a process from Linux, this is practical/pragmatic. Fits w/ Brand's vernacular designing to compare a computer process to a more traditional design process.
- How does all of this fit together?
- What's the take away as designers? (ideals/tools/reuse/access/transparency/etc.?)?

Free/Libre Open Source software (F/LOSS) powers much of the web and the modern tech world. F/LOS hardware powers all manner of maker spaces, workshops, and offices. How do we use these same ideas and mechanisms to the benefit of Graphic Design?

F/LOS in a graphic design context is a useful critical tool. F/LOS's ideals are often outside mainstream capitalism's, providing alternative models for creation and authorship for a design industry increasingly focused on serving clients[rudnick?] (functioning within mainstream capitalism).

Free/Libre Open Source Software (F/LOSS) has a wide reach. GNU/Linux, an open source operating system, and open programs and modules run websites and applications we rely on daily. Open Source has even extended into the corporate sector (at least start up wise) -- Facebook React[^], Adobe Brackets[^] and Phone Gap[^], the IBM Plex typeface[^], many of the underlying technologies to Dropbox[^], etc. -- But, despite most of the internet (and increasingly enterprise backends) running on open source tools (Linux, Apache, Node, PHP, React, etc.) visual design has yet to fully embrace these tools and ideas. What does visual design gain (or preserve?) by not dipping its toes into free/libre/open source? What can we bring to graphic design from F/LOS communities?

## Free as in Freedom

"We need utopian thinking because without it, we are constrained by the tyranny of the possible." -- Stephen Duncombe[^Open Fields]

Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby posit in "Designer As Author" that designers increasingly consider "alternative visions to those put forward by industry."[^Designer as Author] F/LOS presents real opportunities for doing just this. F/LOSS -- Linux, GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus for example -- is _not_ what the mainstream design industry is using. These not only provide alternative softwares that can be critical of "affirmative" (to use D&R's language) tools like Adobe Creative Cloud or Autodesk's suite of programs, but they also come from a differing set of ideological places.

Tracing the lineage of "Open Source" one is led back to Richard Stallman's GNU Manifesto [@fat's talk][@garth DB's talk][TCATB by eric raymond too. Stallman's point of view is idealistic. If we take this ethical point of departure to think about why open source tools for design where does that lead us?[^GNU manifesto] (more history here???). The Golden rule or something.

If proprietary tools create such a problematic ethical scenario, then these ideals are ripe for using critically as well. The tools themselves are easily downloaded and accessed by anyone with an internet connection and semi-modern computer running Linux, Windows or OSX (well, in theory, maybe not fully in practice). So, these are not extreme in and of themselves -- the tools are realistic while the ideals are extreme. Seen this way F/LOS fulfills a different set of Dunne and Raby's ideas -- it can become a design fiction. Presenting an alternative, albeit fictional present to provoke deisgners into questioning their tools, ethics, and ...

That places us in an interesting place -- using Free/Libre/Open Source as a way to create a "fiction" with which to critque the current design industry. One that is a monoculture of operating system, software, and aesthetics. A Wall of aluminum with glowing fuits, and a certain creative cloud being where everyone's inspirations and tools for output now live. Mr. Keedy also talks about the "global style"...

David Rudnick continues to point out that designing is increasingly focused on solving problems of a client, not problems of an audience. Does embracing F/LOS(S) relate to this? [^Strelka talk, Twitter?]

But is there something more useful than just critical opposition to be found in open source?

Rudnick asks us to examine if we are serving the audience or the clients. In his best version of design, the audience is who matters. A client should be hiring you to help them help their audience, not just help them period. Eric Raymond in his essay _The cathedral and the bazaar_ explains how the birth of the linux kernel really created the contemporary idea of open source -- not just that the tools are open and free (as in freedom) -- but that a whole community might actually engage in its advancement. (The GNU creation and maintenance up until that point had, while available to anyone to use, been maintained by limited groups of developers, Linus Torvald was the first to use the methodology we now associate with "Open Source")...[TCATB - intro stuff? TCATB actual essay]

Raymond's analysis is in depth and supported with his own experiments utilizing the same systems. That our contemporary open source communities utilize these commonal, shared practices seems novel. This sounded familiar.

Stewart Brand in his book _How Buildings Learn_ dissects vernacular building. He describes a process that predates the Linux community, yet his description of how a cape cod house came to being sounds uncannily similar to Raymond describing the linux community collaborating on their kernel together. If software can be designed and constructed this way, and vernacular objects can evole this way, why not contemporary visual design?

If open source is really the new vernacular, then something like this: "It is absurdly arrogant to begin the design process with an empty piece of paper"[^]- Hella Jongerius & Louise Schouwenberg (<https://www.readingdesign.org/beyond-the-new>) makes so much sense!

It's really how we've been designing our entire human existence. how can designers recapture this??? (is this defendable?)

What's important from Brand's explanation of the vernacular and Raymond's explanation of the bazaar model is the sharing, and lesser emphasis on individual ownership of the "thing" itself. I don't mean that there isn't individuality or uniqueness of ideas, etc. I mean that even if you have a new idea, you work to integrate it into the community resource, not market/sell it as your own separate things

if anything deserves a reward it is social contribution. Creativity can be a social contribution, but only in so far as society is free to use the results. [GNU Manifesto]

Garth Braithwaite really starts getting at all o this with his _Open Design Manifesto_. Garth isn't concerned w/ designer's embrassing the open licenses that Stallman and Raymond propose (as many design projects would seem to be incapable of fitting into this model [an identity for example]), but he is interested in Designers adopting the sharing mentality. Show how you've gotten somewhere -- if the things themselves can't be forked, at least the process can match -- learning through example? one person solving a thing, the rest sharing in that advance?

So we have on one hand a pragmatic approach that is based in the history of designing, the history of just how we as humans created cultural and societal artifacts, and on the other a critical design approach that intentionally positions itself as different from mainstream capitalist designing.

How to integrate the making into this???

okay! so now how to wrap this up???

- How does all of this fit together?
- What's the take away as designers? (ideals/tools/reuse/access/transparency/etc.?)?
