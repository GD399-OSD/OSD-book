# F/LOS Regularly

Free/Libre Open Source software (F/LOSS) powers much of the web and the modern tech world. F/LOS hardware powers all manner of maker spaces, workshops, and offices. How do we use these same ideas and mechanisms to the benefit of Graphic Design?

Contemporary designers interface with open source through web technologies and frameworks, maybe an operating system -- Facebook React, Adobe Brackets and Phone Gap, Bootstrap, Google Android (and a lot of non-open things are built on top of open things Safari, Dropbox, etc). It's also likely that you've seen or used an open source font (The IBM Plex typeface got some press and fonts.google.com is moving towards serving open source fonts exclusively, making F/LOS type viewable on millions of websites across the internet (Open Sans alone is featured in more than 19,000,000 websites)). But, despite most of the internet being powered by open source tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Node.js, PHP, Drupal, etc.), and that web designers increasingly rely on F/LOS frameworks, text editors, and file formats to do their work, visual design itself has yet to embrace the F/LOS tools nor the F/LOS methodologies available to it.

F/LOS in a graphic design context provides alternative tools for the creation of designs (Inkscape, Nodebox). F/LOS delivers uses file formats that are easier to port across a range of systems and tools (SVG, XML). Lastly, F/LOS furnishes different ideological framing for the creation of cultural artifacts (Free as in Freedom, increased collaboration). Engaging in making with the tools, formats, and ideas creates new opportunities for learning and creating. Through these lenses F/LOS is a useful critical tool for the discipline.

## A Starting place

"Why have developers latched onto the open source movement, but designers have not?" -- Garth Braithwaite

A web search for "Open Source Design" returns a wonderful place to start understanding how F/LOS can immediately have an impact in graphic design. Garth Braithwaite, a designer at Adobe (originally for the open source text editor Brackets, now on some other open source projects still within Adobe), founded an organization called "Design Open" (originally named Open Source Design [DATES!]) Braithwaite's founding manifesto is:

I will:

- find opportunities to design in the open
- share my design experiences; both the good and the bad
- find time for meaningful projects
- openly participate in design discussions
- work with other designers by choice
- improve my toolbox

[Open Source Design Manifesto]

With the _Open Design Manifesto_, and a subsequent talk called "Designers Can Open Source," Braithwaite explores simple actions for designers to immediately become more "open." This revolves around an increase in general sharing: "Sharing process, especially the failures, really helps" and "post as you are working, show how things evolve." This then (hopefully) creates a new kind of design ecosystem where designers are much friendlier and collaborative with their neighbors -- more un-self-concious.

Use tools available to sharing (github, dribbble). This is how open software is developed -- try to use the same tools if possible. Braithwaite mentions one clever thing on dribble -- the rebound! something that actually invites taking something and visually riffing, adding, or remixing to be shared again. This is often what design is missing, or what design has not embraced that open source software has.

That's nice. Designers should share. This is an easy place to start, and yields some potential, but what's next? Braithwaite tells us that designers should be more transparent in how we work, we should share more, but does he give us enough to really start? what about the tools? are there other ideas and tools that would be effective in accelerating this?

## Linus's Law?

The Open Design Manifesto summarizes and recontextualizes thinking done by Eric Raymond in _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_. Raymond explains how the process and systems for designing and building the linux kernel created our current ideas of what open source is -- a distributed community collectively engaging in a tool's advancement. Linus Torvalds, the original programmer behind the linux kernel, practiced several (novel at the time), techniques in sharing his codebase.

As soon as a semi-functioning version of Linux was working, it would be posted for others to use. This "release early, release often" maxim flew in the face of existing software development practice at the time (early 90's). One did not want to release buggy code, it was feared that the users would abandon your project. Raymond found that this was not the case with Linux. "[I]t was clear that something different and much healthier was going on [with Linux]." The success was in how Torvalds was treating his users, and in who his users were. Braithwaite's points draw from Torvalds and Raymond: sharing successes and failures as visual learning opportunities aligns with releasing early and often and allowing your users to help find and fix issues.

The biggest breakthrough, at least in the form of a "rule" for the greater developer communities at large, has come to be known as "Linus's Law." Linus's law (cite raymond + the wikipedia page?) states that "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone," or "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

The early Linux ecosystem was a pool of sharing developers. Updates were released early and often. The persons using these early release tools were the same persons' equiped to find problems with the tools and, and this is key, then actually do something about those problems! By sharing rapidly and without self-conciousness, Linux improved faster and more robustly than it would have otherwise.

Raymond's analysis is supported with his own experiments utilizing the same techniques of continuous release and community aided bug finding and fixing (he built an email program using the same methodologies pulled from Linux). Our contemporary open source communities still utilize these practices.

All this sharing back and forth, community bug fixing, iterating and evolving: this sounded familiar.

## Spectacular Vernacular

"It is absurdly arrogant to begin the design process with an empty piece of paper"[^]- Hella Jongerius & Louise Schouwenberg (<https://www.readingdesign.org/beyond-the-new>)

Stewart Brand's _How Buildings Learn_ dissects vernacular building and describes a process that predates the Linux community, yet sounds uncannily similar. First printed in 1994, _How Buildings Learn_ provides a dissection of historic, cultural architecture in America.

In Brand's view, the vernacular process (which he synonymosly refers to as "adaptive building") is a systematic framework for evolving concepts. A culture steadily culminates these frameworks over time. Traditions subsequently arise allowing vernacular designers to reuse the invented forms and methods for common, everyday (design?) tasks. Contemporary design typically looks for new (or novel?) or wholely unique solution to a given problem, which is counter-productive to creating traditions.

The diagram of the houses evolving???

Vernacular in this context means common designs by common people. What makes cultural common-ness so special is its ability to evolve over time. Common features survive the passage of time when they are generally understood as "good." Over years, the vernacular incorporates more and more "good" features while eradicating "bad" ones.

If software can be designed and constructed this way, and vernacular objects can evolve this way, why not contemporary visual design?

In design we can always pile new ideas on top of old ones. We do not have to reinvent the wheel each time we tackle a problem. Ideas imported from elsewhere, if better at solving problems than our current ideas, are easy to incorporate (this is how present-day open-source communities like Linux function). Our role must be to take the cautious, evolving methodology of vernacular design and apply it alongside our contemporary technologist tendencies and conceptual processes.

It's really how we've been designing our entire human existence. how can designers recapture this??? (is this defendable?)

Linus's Law & Raymond's other explanations on the linux community bug finding and solving sounds a lot like other, older forms of cultural production.

The release early and release often maxim, as well as the "many eyes make light problem solving," mirror older, vernacular processes.

Brand in HBL explores a similar set of ideas in regards to vernacular architecture (cape cod/malay house diagrams)

This was the normal means of cultural production. If our design forbearers could create houses, chairs, clothes, tea kettles, broadsides, tapestries, etc. this way, surely new cultural agents today can find useful ways to collectively create?

that linux was free to distribute and hack was important, not just other things I mentioned?

Raymond's analysis of his own project present two other keys to Linux's success. One was fast friendly distribution over the internet, where all the varaitions, versions, and updates to Linux could all live together and be (relatively easily) accessed. As contemporary designers one has ample access to the internet. There is no shortage of bandwidht and opportunites for sharingdistributing one's work. If we have access to that, then what are we missing? why aren't we sharing more or being more "vernacular?"

Version control: Without any way to track and merge changes this crowd enabled designing isn't very possible. Linus also invented git, a way to track and coordinate files among many users. There are starting to be some much easier to understand visual editors for git workflows. This should start to aid designers in getting into version control as well.

Braithwaite proposes that designers start using github.

Open design is not so open that it is design by committee. Be clear that it is collaborating, not codesigning.

Raymond and Braithwaite are both clear that successful open source things need singular visions and strong leaders.

If cultural artifacts were historically created this way, what happened? why did we stop? is it really just the markets fault? capitalism??? What other values of critical views might we find through our exploring?

enzo mari Autoprogettazione? also drew from vernacular sources. Counter culture DIYers were the previous iteration of this ideal. Mari and Brand both had mail-away versions of this system for their physical objects. For mari, if you mailed him a self-addressed envelope, he sent you the instructions and explanation of his project. For Brand, he created the whole earth catalog, a way to collectively share all manner of materials and ideas in the late 60s through the 80s before everyone had access to the internet that helpe linux take off? These are also the same in concept, and had interesting design implications. Why was it (is it?) that the counter-cultural are drawn to these methods in contmeporary society?

Raymond tells everyone the above version of the Linux story. Raymond's points seem to inspire a lot of people and he then goes onto found the open source foundation and works through the rest of the 90s and early 2000s encouraging tech and communities at large to take advantage of open source ideas. Hurray open source wins (wired article? <https://www.wired.com/2016/08/open-source-won-now/>) now what? That part of the story only covers the Open Source part of F/LOS.

- sharing and transparency is importnat
- community building (& documentation?)
- asking community for feedback is Useful
- those things are aided by the Internet
- you need some good tools.......

But what got us to Open Source in the first place? Brand's vernacular is a a good way of helping undestand this in a more designerly way. The ideas behind open and vernacular point out that all creative efforts worked using communal sourcing of success metrics in the past. Why does Brand see vernacular methods at doibng so many things so well?

## Free as in Freedom

"Free software" and "open source" describe the same category of software, more or less, but say different things about the software, and about values. The GNU Project continues to use the term "free software", to express the idea that freedom, not just technology, is important. [^About The Gnu Project- <https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html>]

The origins of F/LOS are in a critical vein. Stallman's creation of GNU is a critique of what mainstream, proprietary software was turning into at the time. Stallman was writing computer code in the time where the vernacular models were being pushed out by proprietary models of culture creation. Specifically, proprietary computer code. This bothered Stallman as it was offending his morals. He decided to do something about it. / Tracing the lineage of "Open Source" one is led back to Richard Stallman's GNU Manifesto [@fat's talk][@garth DB's talk][TCATB by eric raymond too. Stallman's point of view is idealistic. If we take this ethical point of departure to think about why open source tools for design where does that lead us?[^GNU manifesto] (more history here???).

From _The GNU Project_:

The term "free software" is sometimes misunderstood -- it has nothing to do with price. It is about freedom. Here, therefore, is the definition of free software. A program is free software, for you, a particular user, if:

- You have the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs. (To make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is exceedingly difficult.)
- You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for a fee.
- You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.

Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby posit in _Designer As Author_ that designers should increasingly consider "alternative visions to those put forward by industry." F/LOS presents real opportunities for doing this. Stallman's framing of GNU _is exactly_ this -- GNU is _not_ what the mainstream software is doing. By being free as in freedom, Stallman has created opposition to proprietary, closed-ness that clearly states what is perceived as wrong. By using F/LOS software, not just the concepts or ideals, one immediately engages in a critical design exercise. Inkscape, Linux, Scribus, etc. are _not_ what the design industry is using. These not only provide alternative softwares that can be critical of "affirmative" designs tools like Adobe Creative Cloud or Autodesk's suite of programs, but they also come from a differing set of ideological places. The politics of the systems value freedom over saleable value. Does this become the most important aspect of F/LOS?

"Objects that are critical of industry's agenda are unlikely to be funded by industry ... " [^designer as author]

The marketplace actually looks semi-favourably on "Open Source." but, that terminology was specifics created to get the marketplace to look favorably on OS. Stallman has no interest or concern whether the marketplace is into Free software.

If proprietary tools create problematic ethical scenarios, then F/LOS utopian thinking is ripe for using critically. The tools themselves are downloadable and accessed by anyone with an internet connection and semi-modern computer running Linux, Windows or OSX (well, in theory, maybe not fully in practice). So, these are not extreme in and of themselves -- the tools are realistic while the ideals are extreme. Seen this way F/LOS fulfills a different set of Dunne and Raby's ideas -- it can become a design fiction. Presenting an alternative, albeit fictional present to provoke designers into questioning their tools, ethics, and ...

That places us in an interesting place -- using Free/Libre/Open Source as a way critique the current design industry. One that is a monoculture of operating system, software, and aesthetics. A Wall of aluminum with glowing fuits, and a certain creative cloud being where everyone's inspirations and tools for output now live.

Designer David Rudnick points out that designing is increasingly focused on solving problems of a client, not problems of an audience.[^Strelka talk, Twitter?] Embracing F/LOS(S) is one way aaround this. Rudnick asks if we are serving the audience or the clients. In his best version of design, the audience is who matters. A client should be hiring you to help them help their audience, not just help them period. This aligns w/ stallman's view of the user and software.

"If anything deserves a reward it is social contribution. Creativity can be a social contribution, but only in so far as society is free to use the results." -- [GNU Manifesto]

## Free doesn't mean easy

So we have on one hand a pragmatic approach that is based in the history of designing, the history of just how we as humans created cultural and societal artifacts, and on the other a critical design approach that intentionally positions itself as different from mainstream capitalist designing.

So there is a spectrum of making that falls into "F/LOS designing." If you are on the critical design fence, then moving whole heartedly to all F/LOS replacements for the normal tools of a designer is required. It becomes almost a performance piece to intentionally point out the moderno-capitalist mono culture the F/LOS stance (again in Stallman-esque, Critical design-esque extreme terms) is in opposition too.

okay! so now how to wrap this up???

- How does all of this fit together?
- What's the take away as designers? (ideals/tools/reuse/access/transparency/etc.?)?

There are barriers to doing this as a visual designer. The main one is by choosing openness, transparency, and sharing you are working in a way that is at odds w/ much of how corporate design wants us to behave.

## Be the Designer with a bigger toolbox

An advanatage to these F/LOS tools is that since they use file types that are built on open standards, and that are often just specialty versions of XML files, they are just text files! they can relaly easily be tracked and shared with tools that make a workflow of collaborating, sharing, etc. easy.

What do you see out there when you look for open source design? Fonts, Icons, Templates, Frameworks. Is this what F/LOS design means? Is that all that's possible?

Is it important that the source is shareable or is it important that the spirit is embraced?

We get the internet, we've got version control, we're into the mindset of transparent and sharing, etc. Is that enogh? how does that make design/designing better? what does that do other than help on individual, creative levels?

GarthDB:

This isn't crazy or extreme, Braithwaite acknowledges that not all design projects or outcomes can be shared. One doesn't want another designer to just wholesale copy and reuse a logo one has made. However, how brand guidelines themselves are setup might be a thing to share, or the process you used to arrive at the final product could be shared, or the discarded work and why it was discarded might be shareable (and reusable?) after the fact. Those are all ways to be more "open" in your designing.

Don't forget to mention who inspired you as you go. Be open.

Open source design does not mean so open that it is designed by community. Pretty clear that this is collaborating, not co-designing.

But how? If a key part of the F/LOS ecosystem is that sharing and collaboration are built into the culture and systems and tools how is that done? what can we learn to make sharing more present in our designing?

Brand/HBL:

Vernacular architecture? now that I think I can apply to visual designing...

Brand has had a lifelong impact on progressive thinking and the sustainability movement through the _Whole Earth Catalog_ (which he helped found in 1968), the first Hacker's Conference (1984), and the Long-Now foundation (1996). Because of his varied interests, Brand approaches the vernacular with more than just an aesthetic view.

GNU:

"The principal goal of GNU is to be free software. Even if GNU had no technical advantage over Unix, it would have a social advantage, allowing users to cooperate, and an ethical advantage, respecting the user's freedom." [^About The Gnu Project- <https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html>]
