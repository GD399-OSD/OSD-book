# F/LOS Regularly

Free/Libre Open Source software (F/LOSS) powers much of the web and the modern tech world. F/LOS hardware powers all manner of maker spaces, workshops, and offices. How do we use these same ideas and mechanisms to the benefit of Graphic Design?

Contemporary designers interface with open source through web technologies and frameworks, maybe an operating system -- Facebook React, Adobe Brackets and Phone Gap, Bootstrap, Google Android (and a lot of non-open things are built on top of open things Safari, Dropbox, etc). It's also likely that you've seen or used an open source font (The IBM Plex typeface got some press and fonts.google.com is moving towards serving open source fonts exclusively, making F/LOS type viewable on millions of websites across the internet (Open Sans alone is featured in more than 19,000,000 websites)). But, despite most of the internet being powered by open source tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Node.js, PHP, Drupal, etc.), and that web designers increasingly rely on F/LOS frameworks, text editors, and file formats to do their work, visual design itself has yet to embrace the F/LOS tools nor the F/LOS methodologies available to it.

F/LOS in a graphic design context provides alternative tools for the creation of designs (Inkscape, Nodebox), file formats that are easier to port across a range of systems and tools (SVG, XML), and a different ideological framing for the creation of cultural artifact (Free as in Freedom, increased collaboration). Engaging in making with the tools, formats, and ideas creates new opportunities for learning and creating. Through these lenses F/LOS is a useful critical tool for the discipline.

## A Starting place

"Why have developers latched onto the open source movement, but designers have not?" -- Garth Braithwaite

A web search for "Open Source Design" returns a wonderful place to start understanding how F/LOS can immediately have an impact in graphic design. Garth Braithwaite, a designer at Adobe (originally for the open source text editor Brackets, now on some other open source projects still within Adobe), founded an organization called "Design Open" (originally named Open Source Design [DATES!]) Braithwaite's founding manifesto is:

I will:

- find opportunities to design in the open
- share my design experiences; both the good and the bad
- find time for meaningful projects
- openly participate in design discussions
- work with other designers by choice
- improve my toolbox

[Open Source Design Manifesto]

With the _Open Design Manifesto_, and a subsequent talk called "Designers Can Open Source," Braithwaite explores simple actions for designers to immediately become more "open." This revolves around an increase in general sharing: "Sharing process, especially the failures, really helps" and "post as you are working, show how things evolve." This then (hopefully) creates a new kind of design ecosystem where designers are much friendlier and collaborative with their neighbors -- more un-self-concious.

Use tools available to sharing (github, dribbble). This is how open software is developed -- try to use the same tools if possible. Braithwaite mentions one clever thing on dribble -- the rebound! something that actually invites taking something and visually riffing, adding, or remixing to be shared again. This is often what design is missing, or what design has not embraced that open source software has.

That's nice. Designers should share. This is an easy place to start, and yields some good things, but how? is there more? Braithwaite tells us that designers should be more transparent in how we work, we should share more, but does he give us enough how? what about the tools? are there other ideas and tools that would be effective in accelerating this?

## Linus's Law?

The Open Design Manifesto summarizes and recontextualizes thinking done by Eric Raymond in _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_. Raymond explains how the linux kernel and the systems that grew up around it created our current ideas of what open source is -- that a distributed community might engage collectively in a tool's advancement. Linus Torvalds, the original programmer behind the linux kernel (and the main maintainer of the linux project as it has grown), practiced several (novel at the time), techiniques in sharing his codebase. As soon as a semi-functioning version of Linux was working, it would be posted for others to use. This "release early, release often" maxim flew in the face of existing software development practice at the time (early 90's). One did not want to release buggy code, it was feared that the users would abandon your project. Raymond found that this was not the case with Linux. "[I]t was clear that something different and much healthier was going on [with Linux]." The success was in how Torvalds was treating his users, and in who his users were. Braithwaite's points draw from Torvalds and Raymond: sharing successes and failures as visual learning opportunities aligns with releasing early and often and allowing your users to help find and fix issues.

The biggest breakthrough, at least in the form of a "rule" for the greater developer communities at large, was "Linus's Law." Linus's law (cite raymond + the wikipedia page?) states that "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone," or "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." The early Linux ecosystem was a pool of sharing developers. Updates were released early and often. The persons using these early release tools were the same persons' equiped to find problems with the tools and, and this is key, then actually do something about those problems! By sharing rapidly and without self-conciousness, Linux improved faster and more robustly than it would have otherwise.

Raymond's analysis is supported with his own experiments utilizing the same techniques of continuous release and community aided bug finding and fixing (he built an email program using the same methodologies pulled from Linux). Our contemporary open source communities still utilize these practices.

All this sharing back and forth, community bug fixing, iterating and evolving: this sounded familiar.

## Spectacular Vernacular

"It is absurdly arrogant to begin the design process with an empty piece of paper"[^]- Hella Jongerius & Louise Schouwenberg (<https://www.readingdesign.org/beyond-the-new>)

Stewart Brand's _How Buildings Learn_ dissects vernacular building and describes a process that predates the Linux community, yet sounds uncannily similar. First printed in 1994, _How Buildings Learn_ provides a dissection of historic, cultural architecture in America.

If software can be designed and constructed this way, and vernacular objects can evole this way, why not contemporary visual design?

Vernacular architecture? now that I think I can apply to visual designing...

Brand has had a lifelong impact on progressive thinking and the sustainability movement through the _Whole Earth Catalog_ (which he helped found in 1968), the first Hacker's Conference (1984), and the Long-Now foundation (1996). Because of his varied interests, Brand approaches the vernacular with more than just an aesthetic view.

In Brand's more academic view, the vernacular process (which he also refers to as "adaptive building") is a systematic framework for evolving concepts. A culture steadily culminates these frameworks over time. Traditions subsequently arise allowing vernacular designers to reuse the invented forms and methods for common, everyday (design?) tasks. Contemporary design typically looks for new (or novel?) or wholely unique solution to a given problem, which is counter-productive to creating traditions.

The diagram of the houses evolving???

Stewart Brand defines vernacular as the indigenous building of a place. Vernacular more broadly means common designs by common people. What makes cultural common-ness so special is its ability to evolve steadily over time. Common features survive the passage of time when they are generally understood as "good." Over years, the vernacular incorporates more and more "good" features while eradicating "bad" ones.

While we (as professional designers) cannot always behave as conservatively as vernacular designers, that doesn't mean we cannot adopt their "common" ideals of constraint, durability, and thrift. In design we can always pile new ideas on top of old ones. We do not have to reinvent the wheel each time we tackle a problem. Ideas imported from elsewhere, if better at solving problems than our current ideas, are easy to incorporate (this is how present-day open-source communities function). Our role must be to take the cautious, evolving methodology of vernacular design and apply it alongside our contemporary technologist tendencies and conceptual processes.

It's really how we've been designing our entire human existence. how can designers recapture this??? (is this defendable?)

If software can be designed and constructed this way, and vernacular objects can evole this way, why not contemporary visual design?

Vernacular architecture? now that I think I can apply to visual designing...

## Free as in Freedom

Jump right into Dunne and raby? Go from Hella Jongerius & Louise Schouwenberg to dunne and raby to stallman?

Enzo mari fits into this part too?

The origins of F/LOS are in a Dunne and Raby-ian critical design vein. Stallman's thinking and subsequent release of GNU is a critique of what mainstream, proprietary software became.

F/LOS mythologies normally begin with Richard Stallman's creation of GNU. This story includes some version of the following: Stallman is working away at the MIT AI lab. Their printer is slow and so Stallman asks for the source code and fixes the problem. The next version of the printer has the same issue -- but Xerox will not send over the source. This is the straw that breaks the camel's back as it were, and Stallman runs off to start the GNU project so that he can avoid nondisclosures and proprietary software and be free to share with his programming neighbors.

Go through the GNU manifesto and mark how its useful ideologically?

From _The GNU Project_: The term "free software" is sometimes misunderstood -- it has nothing to do with price. It is about freedom. Here, therefore, is the definition of free software.

A program is free software, for you, a particular user, if:

- You have the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- You have the freedom to modify the program to suit your needs. (To make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is exceedingly difficult.)
- You have the freedom to redistribute copies, either gratis or for a fee.
- You have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.

"The principal goal of GNU is to be free software. Even if GNU had no technical advantage over Unix, it would have a social advantage, allowing users to cooperate, and an ethical advantage, respecting the user's freedom." [^About The Gnu Project- <https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html>]

"Free software" and "open source" describe the same category of software, more or less, but say different things about the software, and about values. The GNU Project continues to use the term "free software", to express the idea that freedom, not just technology, is important. [^About The Gnu Project- <https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html>]

Stallman is really here creating a critical design stance. Good segway to D&R.

Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby posit in "Designer As Author" that designers increasingly consider "alternative visions to those put forward by industry."[^Designer as Author] F/LOS presents real opportunities for doing just this. Stallman's framing of GNU is exactly this -- GNU is _not_ what the mainstream software is doing. So perhaps by using F/LOSS then a designer immediately engages in a ciritcal design exercise. Inkscape, Linux, Scribus, etc. are _not_ what the design industry is using. These not only provide alternative softwares that can be critical of "affirmative" designs (to use D&R's language) tools like Adobe Creative Cloud or Autodesk's suite of programs, but they also come from a differing set of ideological places.

"Objects that are critical of industry's agenda are unlikely to be funded by industry ... Deisgn needs to mature and find ways of operating outside the tight constraints of servicing industry." [^designer as author]

The social value of our work should not be tied to the marketplace...

Does your designing match your ethics? does desinging just reinforce global capitalist values?

Tracing the lineage of "Open Source" one is led back to Richard Stallman's GNU Manifesto [@fat's talk][@garth DB's talk][TCATB by eric raymond too. Stallman's point of view is idealistic. If we take this ethical point of departure to think about why open source tools for design where does that lead us?[^GNU manifesto] (more history here???).

If proprietary tools create such a problematic ethical scenario, then these ideals are ripe for using critically as well. The tools themselves are easily downloaded and accessed by anyone with an internet connection and semi-modern computer running Linux, Windows or OSX (well, in theory, maybe not fully in practice). So, these are not extreme in and of themselves -- the tools are realistic while the ideals are extreme. Seen this way F/LOS fulfills a different set of Dunne and Raby's ideas -- it can become a design fiction. Presenting an alternative, albeit fictional present to provoke designers into questioning their tools, ethics, and ...

That places us in an interesting place -- using Free/Libre/Open Source as a way to create a "fiction" with which to critique the current design industry. One that is a monoculture of operating system, software, and aesthetics. A Wall of aluminum with glowing fuits, and a certain creative cloud being where everyone's inspirations and tools for output now live.

David Rudnick continues to point out that designing is increasingly focused on solving problems of a client, not problems of an audience. Does embracing F/LOS(S) relate to this? [^Strelka talk, Twitter?]

But is there something more useful than just critical opposition to be found in open source?

Rudnick asks us to examine if we are serving the audience or the clients. In his best version of design, the audience is who matters. A client should be hiring you to help them help their audience, not just help them period.

if anything deserves a reward it is social contribution. Creativity can be a social contribution, but only in so far as society is free to use the results. [GNU Manifesto]

## Free doesn't mean easy

So we have on one hand a pragmatic approach that is based in the history of designing, the history of just how we as humans created cultural and societal artifacts, and on the other a critical design approach that intentionally positions itself as different from mainstream capitalist designing.

So there is a spectrum of making that falls into "F/LOS designing." If you are on the critical design fence, then moving whole heartedly to all F/LOS replacements for the normal tools of a designer is required. It becomes almost a performance piece to intentionally point out the moderno-capitalist mono culture the F/LOS stance (again in Stallman-esque, Critical design-esque extreme terms) is in opposition too.

okay! so now how to wrap this up???

- How does all of this fit together?
- What's the take away as designers? (ideals/tools/reuse/access/transparency/etc.?)?

There are barriers to doing this as a visual designer. The main one is by choosing openness, transparency, and sharing you are working in a way that is at odds w/ much of how

## Be the Designer with a bigger toolbox

An advanatage to these F/LOS tools is that since they use file types that are built on open standards, and that are often just specialty versions of XML files, they are just text files! they can relaly easily be tracked and shared with tools that make a workflow of collaborating, sharing, etc. easy.

SVG?

Scribus XML files?

Nodebox XML files?

What do you see out there when you look for open source design? Fonts, Icons, Templates, Frameworks. Is this what F/LOS design means? Is that all that's possible?

Is it important that the source is shareable or is it important that the spirit is embraced?

GarthDB:

This isn't crazy or extreme, Braithwaite acknowledges that not all design projects or outcomes can be shared. One doesn't want another designer to just wholesale copy and reuse a logo one has made. However, how brand guidelines themselves are setup might be a thing to share, or the process you used to arrive at the final product could be shared, or the discarded work and why it was discarded might be shareable (and reusable?) after the fact. Those are all ways to be more "open" in your designing.

Don't forget to mention who inspired you as you go. Be open.

Open source design does not mean so open that it is designed by community. Pretty clear that this is collaborating, not co-designing.

But how? If a key part of the F/LOS ecosystem is that sharing and collaboration are built into the culture and systems and tools how is that done? what can we learn to make sharing more present in our designing?
