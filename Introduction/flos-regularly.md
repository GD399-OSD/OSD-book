# F/LOS Regularly[^1]

## (or, the Libre Graphic Designer)

"We need utopian thinking because without it, we are constrained by the tyranny of the possible." -- Stephen Duncombe

When you hear "Open Source," an image of an aging techno-hippie, linux laptop toting developer, or silicon-valley millennial might come to mind. What probably would not pop into your head is a graphic designer.

You also don't typically think easy to use, pleasant to look at, good user experience tools. Issues with UI and ability for "professional" outputs. This is partially due to the fact that most of the users and developers of these things are not designers (they are developers who need a design tool, or hobbyists or hackers).

Libre Design

Design Fiction

Values are extreme but the "stuff" is more or less conservative.

Challenge preconceptions about how software shapes our profession and pedagogy.

In order for conceptual

Dunne and Raby talk about speculative design -- that design should create an alternative to the status quo. When they talk about speculative deisgn or design fictions they are often presenting ideas related to using more or less conservative technologies/designs, but presenting values that are extreme.

One way to engage in a "design fiction" of ones own is to choose F/LOS tools over our traditional ones. Arriving in a typically design classroom, one is presented with a wall of aluminum and glowing white fruit (or maybe space gray). Behind these glowing walls students will likely be typing and clicking around with the Adobe Creative Cloud.

Is it problematic that an entire discipline shares not standard formats necessarily, but standard machines and softwares? If we are all using the sam einterfaces, the same programs for output, the same filetypes for input (file types that often prohibit other tools/users from being able to engage with them) what is lost in the disciplne of design? what kings of making are we prohibiting? what outcomes are not achievable? What learning opportunities are being missed or negated?

## Spectacular Vernacular

Enzo Mari's project Autoprogettazione? asked users of furniture to learn about how the furniture was structurally built in the hopes that by participating in the act of construction, one would learn what makes a table or chair or bed frame stable -- what makes a piece of furniture "good" at more than a surface, purely style based evaluation.

Critical design claims?

He arrived at this place through observing the traditional, ad hoc methods of building employed by carpenters, masons, etc. for utilitarian needs. These vernacular solutions inspired ???

Move to brand? that vernacular thing is the switch?

How to get back to open source?

## The Golden Rule

Stallman?

Do unto others?

How to get to teaching?

## A New toolbox

What are we teaching in our graphic design classes? Are we teaching students to use the Adobe Creative Suite -- or are we teaching them designing?

How does the new toolbox solve whatever things I mention before???

Teaching is more difficult than learning because what teaching calls for is this: to let learn. The real teacher, in fact, lets nothing else be learned than learning. His conduct, therefore, often produces the impression that we learn nothing from him, if by 'learning' we now suddenly understand merely the procurement of useful information. -- Martin Heidegger

[1]: F/LOS stands for "Free/Libre Open Source," it describes anything that fits into the realm of "free as in freedom," either the original Richard Stallman, GNU meaning of "free," to the more contemporary business friendly open source... It is also employed as F/LOSS -- the last S meaning "Software" -- Free/Libre Open Source Software.
