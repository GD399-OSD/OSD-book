"We need utopian thinking because without it, we are constrained by the tyranny of the possible." -- Stephen Duncombe

When you hear "Open Source," an image of an aging techno-hippie, linux laptop toting developer, or silicon-valley millenial might come to mind. What doesn't probably come to mind is a graphic designer.

You also don't typically think easy to use, pleasant to look at, good user experience tools. Issues with UI and ability for "professional" outputs. This is partially due to the fact that most of the users and developers of these things are not designers (they are developers who need a design tool, or hobbyists or hackers).
