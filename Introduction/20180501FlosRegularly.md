# F/LOS Regularly.

One of my goals as an educator is to help create new knowledge for my discipline. Through a special course I ran from January to May of 2018, Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source, I (with the help of my class) explored new tools and ideologies for making design. To do this I decided to utilize Free/Libre Open Source software (F/LOS(s)) as a critical tool for engaging in new methods of making and thinking.

The course acted as a skeleton to build upon for the students enrolled. Each student was asked to attempt to use F/LOS tools in the making of their design projects, and to experiment with how the ideas and technologies could serve their needs not only in our class, but for all their projects this term.

While using some of the F/LOS software for final outcomes wasn't always possible (we worked on templates for our school library for example, they still needed things in InDesign), the conversations we had in the classroom and ideas that surfaced from readings and visitors made their way into student work in and beyond our class.

## A Starting place

The original spark for this course was a visit by David Crossland to the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). Crossland was visiting MICA as a representative of Google Fonts. After showing off some new variable type that Google and Type Network were working on together, Crossland explained how he had ended up working at Google Fonts in the first place: being a lover of open source. While I had been using F/LOS type myself as part of sustainability related constraints, I had not thought much about the larger "open source design" ecosystem. Crossland's talk presented new territory.

Interestingly, MICA had also recently been visited by Loraine Furter and Eric Schrijver, two members of a collective known as "Open Source Publishing" (OSP). They had done two workshops in as many years, one related to using public domain resources, and one related to customizing open source fonts. After meeting them upon their first visit I had explored the OSP site (OSP.kitchen), and found their work interesting and thought provoking, but hadn't given it much thought afterward. Crossland's visit seemed like one too many coincidences. I had to dive deeper. These ideas needed a class.
