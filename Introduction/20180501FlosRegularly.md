# F/LOS Regularly.

One of my goals as an educator is to help create new knowledge for my discipline. Through a special course I ran from January to May of 2018, Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source, I (with the help of my class) explored new tools and ideologies for making design. To do this I decided to utilize Free/Libre Open Source software (F/LOS(s)) as a critical tool for engaging in new methods of making and thinking.

The course acted as a skeleton to build upon for the students enrolled. Each student was asked to attempt to use F/LOS tools in the making of their design projects, and to experiment with how the ideas and technologies could serve their needs not only in our class, but for all their projects this term.

While using some of the F/LOS software for final outcomes wasn't always possible (we worked on templates for our school library for example, they still needed things in InDesign), the conversations we had in the classroom and ideas that surfaced from readings and visitors made their way into student work in and beyond our class.

## A Starting place

The original spark for this course was a visit by David Crossland to the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). Crossland was visiting MICA as a representative of Google Fonts. After showing off some new variable type that Google and Type Network were working on together, Crossland explained how he had ended up working at Google Fonts in the first place: being a lover of open source. While I had been using F/LOS type myself as part of sustainability related constraints, I had not thought much about the larger "open source design" ecosystem. Crossland's talk presented new territory.

MICA had also recently been visited by Loraine Furter and Eric Schrijver, two members of a collective known as "Open Source Publishing" (OSP). They had done two workshops in as many years, one related to using public domain resources, and one related to customizing open source fonts. After meeting them upon their first visit I had explored the OSP site (OSP.kitchen), and found their work interesting and thought provoking, but hadn't given it much thought afterward. Crossland's visit seemed like one too many coincidences. I had to dive deeper. These ideas needed a class.

## Open Source Design

"Why have developers latched onto the open source movement, but designers have not?" -- Garth Braithwaite

A web search for "Open Source Design" returns quite a few resources to start understanding how F/LOS can have an impact in graphic design. Near the top of the list is "The Open Source Design Manifesto" by Garth Braithwaite, a designer at Adobe (originally for the open source text editor Brackets, now on some other open source projects still within Adobe), The manifesto is as follows:

I will:

- find opportunities to design in the open
- share my design experiences; both the good and the bad
- find time for meaningful projects
- openly participate in design discussions
- work with other designers by choice
- improve my toolbox

[cite Open Source Design Manifesto, originally Published on Sep 25, 2013]

With the _Open Design Manifesto_, and a 2013 talk called "Designers Can Open Source,"[cite treehouse?] Braithwaite explores simple actions and behavioral changes for designers to immediately become more "open." This revolves around an increase in general sharing: "Sharing process, especially the failures, really helps" and "post as you are working, show how things evolve." This (hopefully) creates a new kind of design ecosystem where designers are much friendlier and collaborative with their neighbors -- more un-self-concious. Braithwaite summarizes some of the history of the open source movement, and then also points to some tools that help in doing his points.

We read the manifesto and watched Braithwaite's presentation as a class. In response, we decided to post all of our work on github and to record all of our discussions. Utilizing github and recording our conversations made the class immediately feel like something different from the typical studio. This felt like a good place to begin the term. [links?]

As a class we had decided to be open, to share more, to start to utilize at least one tool of open source developers (github), but where did this way of working come from?
