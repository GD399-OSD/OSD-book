# F/LOS Regularly.

One of my goals as an educator is to help create new knowledge for my discipline. Through a special course I ran from January to May of 2018, Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source, I (with the help of my class) explored new tools and ideologies for making design. To do this I decided to utilize Free/Libre Open Source software (F/LOS(s)) as a critical tool for engaging in new methods of making and thinking.

The course acted as a skeleton to build upon for the students enrolled. Each student was asked to attempt to use F/LOS tools in the making of their design projects, and to experiment with how the ideas and technologies could serve their needs not only in our class, but for all their projects this term.

While using some of the F/LOS software for final outcomes wasn't always possible (we worked on templates for our school library for example, they still needed things in InDesign), the conversations we had in the classroom and ideas that surfaced from readings and visitors made their way into student work in and beyond our class.

## A Starting place

The original spark for this course was a visit by David Crossland to the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). Crossland was visiting MICA as a representative of Google Fonts. After showing off some new variable type that Google and Type Network were working on together, Crossland explained how he had ended up working at Google Fonts in the first place: being a lover of open source. While I had been using F/LOS type myself as part of sustainability related constraints, I had not thought much about the larger "open source design" ecosystem. Crossland's talk presented new territory.

MICA had also recently been visited by Loraine Furter and Eric Schrijver, two members of a collective known as "Open Source Publishing" (OSP). They had done two workshops in as many years, one related to using public domain resources, and one related to customizing open source fonts. After meeting them upon their first visit I had explored the OSP site (OSP.kitchen), and found their work interesting and thought provoking, but hadn't given it much thought afterward. Crossland's visit seemed like one too many coincidences. I had to dive deeper. These ideas needed a class.

## Open Source Design

"Why have developers latched onto the open source movement, but designers have not?" -- Garth Braithwaite

A web search for "Open Source Design" returns quite a few resources to start understanding how F/LOS can have an impact in graphic design. Near the top of the list is "The Open Source Design Manifesto" by Garth Braithwaite, a designer at Adobe (originally for the open source text editor Brackets, now on some other open source projects still within Adobe), The manifesto is as follows:

I will:

- find opportunities to design in the open
- share my design experiences; both the good and the bad
- find time for meaningful projects
- openly participate in design discussions
- work with other designers by choice
- improve my toolbox

[cite Open Source Design Manifesto, originally Published on Sep 25, 2013]

With the _Open Design Manifesto_, and a 2013 talk called "Designers Can Open Source,"[cite treehouse?] Braithwaite explores simple actions and behavioral changes for designers to immediately become more "open." This revolves around an increase in general sharing: "Sharing process, especially the failures, really helps" and "post as you are working, show how things evolve." This (hopefully) creates a new kind of design ecosystem where designers are much friendlier and collaborative with their neighbors -- more un-self-concious. Braithwaite summarizes some of the history of the open source movement, and then also points to some tools that help in doing his points.

We read the manifesto and watched Braithwaite's presentation as a class. In response, we decided to post all of our work on github and to record all of our discussions. Utilizing github and recording our conversations made the class immediately feel like something different from the typical studio. This felt like a good place to begin the term. [links?]

As a class we had decided to be open, to share more, to start to utilize at least one tool of open source developers (github), but where did this way of working come from?

## Linus's law

The way we think about and talk about open source today is rooted in _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_ by Eric Raymond. In this essay, Raymond analyzes how Linus Torvalds, and the distributed hacker crew Torvalds helped lead, developed the Linux Kernel. Raymond outlines and explains nineteen points key to Linux's and Linus's successes. There are two in particular that better actualize Braithwaite's sentiments -- and clearly outline what is understood as "open source" today.

As soon as a semi-functioning version of Linux was working, it would be posted for others to use. This "release early, release often" maxim flew in the face of existing software development practice -- the cathedral model. One did not want to release buggy code, it was feared that users would abandon your project. Raymond found that this was not the case with Linux. "[I]t was clear that something different and much healthier was going on [with Linux]." The success was in how Torvalds was treating his users -- they were being treated as colleagues and co-developers. Release early and often is a predicate for Raymond's key takeaway from his analysis: "Linus's Law." Linus's law states that "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone," or "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."[cite raymond + the wikipedia page?] Basically, get as many users as you can to look at and tinker with your stuff, and make sure they tell you about everything wrong that they find.

This is what Braithwaite is trying to get designers to understand that developers seem to have latched onto: many eyes make light work. In graphic design we are trying to find the best visual solutions -- but how often do we throw out partially formed ideas and see if anyone can poke holes (or find pain points we didn't plan on) early in the process? This can be done within a classroom or studio between colleagues -- as things come together make sure you're passing things around between desks/desktops -- or it can take place out in the world at large (via something like Dribbble? Github? Behance?).

## Not just Theory

What Raymond is describing in _TCATB_ is actually not anything novel. There are other structures that enable cultural creation via means that are distributed, include "bug fixes" from the community, and shared and forked: vernacular design. What is described by Raymond, and what has been adopted by F/LOS communities is really not so different from the way that most human creations came to be.

In _How Buildings Learn_, Stewart Brand dissects vernacular building and describes a process that predates the Linux community, yet sounds uncannily similar. In Brand's view, the vernacular process is a systematic framework for evolving concepts. A culture steadily culminates frameworks over time. Vernacular designers reuse the invented forms and methods for common, everyday tasks. Contemporary design typically looks for new or unique solution to a given problem, which is counter-productive to creating traditions.

Vernacular in this context means common designs by common people. Common features survive the passage of time when they are generally understood as "good." Over years, the vernacular incorporates more and more "good" features while eradicating "bad" ones.

To illustrate this in _HBL_, Brand references the Cape Cod house. He includes a wonderful diagram called "The Evolution Chart of the Siasconset Whale House," which visualizes what Raymond is trying to explain to us in _TCATB_ (and that Braithwaite also wants contemporary designers to get), that simple things released into the wild of a user community will grow, evolve, and change -- and will come back with improvements. The improvements are merged into the computer code or architectural language. Repeat. Torvalds is a genius to Raymond not because he uncovered something brand new, but in that he managed to take an existing form of cultural production and accelerate and decentralize it so as to maximize the merging of fixes and improvments and new features!

If software can be designed and constructed this way, and vernacular objects evolve this way, why not contemporary visual design?

## Free as in Freedom

Is there something actually special or unique about the aims of a visual designer that preclude the open ness that braithwaite, raymond, and our vernacular forebearers practice? Is there something about the culture of Graphic Design that makes these F/LOS ideas uncomfortable?

There are some other design precedents for this type of "F/LOS" designing. Enzo Mari's Autoprogettazione? is one example. Mari designed a series of tables and chairs to be made with simple boards and nails. One just had to contact Mari w/ a self-addressed stamped envelope and his studio would mail you all the plans. He asked for pictures of the constructed pieces in return, and if you had modified anything to let him know how that worked out. Stewart Brand also helped start the _Whole Earth Catalog_, which included in its pages all manner of books and kits for making furniture, houses, etc. that all had similar ideals: we give you the instructions, you try to make it yourself, and if you come up with something new or interesting or solve a problem inherent in the original, please contribute that back. So, if Enzo Mari and Victor Papanek -- both historically important designers -- are capable of working this way, all designers should be.

Maybe the issue isn't designing itself, but how design had been framed? Our class was constantly struggling with the ideals of transparency and openness and how that clashed with the moderno-capitalist design machinery that tends to outline design practice (and design education).

What is the underlying ideology driving F/LOS -- if we could get to that would it help answer more of our questions?
