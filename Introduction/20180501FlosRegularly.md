# F/LOS Regularly.

Through a new course I ran from January to May of 2018 -- Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source -- at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), I (with the help of my class) explored new tools and ideologies for making design. To do this I decided to utilize Free/Libre Open Source software (F/LOS(s)) as a critical tool for engaging in new methods of making and thinking.

The course was setup as a skeleton to be built upon by the students. Each student was asked to use F/LOS tools in the making of their design projects all semester, and to experiment with how the ideas and technologies served their needs not only in our class, but for all their projects.

While using some of the F/LOS software for final outcomes wasn't always possible (we worked on templates for our school library for example, they still needed things in InDesign), the conversations we had and ideas that surfaced from readings and classroom visitors made their way into student work inside and outside of our class.

## A Starting place

The original spark for this course was a Google Fonts related visit to MICA by David Crossland. After showing off some new open source variable type that Google and Type Network were working on, Crossland explained how he had ended up working at Google Fonts in the first place: being a lover of open source. While I had been using F/LOS fonts myself as part of sustainability related constraints, I had not thought much about the larger "open source design" ecosystem.

MICA had also recently been visited by Loraine Furter and Eric Schrijver, two members of a collective known as "Open Source Publishing" (OSP). They had done two workshops in as many years, one related to using public domain resources, and one related to customizing open source fonts. Crossland's visit seemed like one too many coincidences. I had to dive deeper. These ideas needed a class.

## Open Source Design

"Why have developers latched onto the open source movement, but designers have not?" -- Garth Braithwaite

A web search for "Open Source Design" returns quite a few resources to start understanding how F/LOS has a graphic design impact. Near the top of the list is "The Open Source Design Manifesto" by Garth Braithwaite, a designer at Adobe (originally for the open source text editor Brackets, now on some other open source projects still within Adobe), The manifesto is as follows:

```
I will:

- find opportunities to design in the open
- share my design experiences; both the good and the bad
- find time for meaningful projects
- openly participate in design discussions
- work with other designers by choice
- improve my toolbox
```

[cite Open Source Design Manifesto, originally Published on Sep 25, 2013]

With the _Open Design Manifesto_, and a 2013 talk called "Designers Can Open Source,"[cite treehouse?] Braithwaite explores simple actions and behavioral changes for designers to immediately become more "open." This revolves around an increase in general sharing: "Sharing process, especially the failures, really helps" and "post as you are working, show how things evolve." This (hopefully) creates a new kind of design ecosystem where designers are much friendlier and collaborative with their neighbors -- more un-self-concious. Braithwaite summarizes some of the history of the open source movement, and then also points to some tools that help in doing his points.

We read the manifesto and watched Braithwaite's presentation as a class. In response, we decided to post all of our work on github and to record all of our discussions. Utilizing github and recording our conversations made the class immediately feel like something different from the typical studio. This felt like a good place to begin the term. [links?]

As a class we had decided to be open, to share more, to start to utilize at least one tool of open source developers (github), but where did this way of working come from?

## Linus's law

The way we think about and talk about open source today is rooted in _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_ by Eric Raymond. In this essay, Raymond analyzes how Linus Torvalds, and the distributed hacker crew Torvalds helped lead, developed the Linux Kernel. Raymond outlines and explains nineteen points key to Linux's and Linus's successes. There are two in particular that better actualize Braithwaite's sentiments -- and clearly outline what is understood as "open source" today.

As soon as a semi-functioning version of Linux was working, it would be posted for others to use. This "release early, release often" maxim flew in the face of existing software development practice -- the cathedral model. One did not want to release buggy code, it was feared that users would abandon your project. Raymond found that this was not the case with Linux. "[I]t was clear that something different and much healthier was going on [with Linux]." The success was in how Torvalds was treating his users -- they were being treated as colleagues and co-developers. Release early and often is a predicate for Raymond's key takeaway from his analysis: "Linus's Law." Linus's law states that "Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone," or "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."[cite raymond + the wikipedia page?] Basically, get as many users as you can to look at and tinker with your stuff, and make sure they tell you about everything wrong that they find.

This is what Braithwaite is trying to get designers to understand that developers seem to have latched onto: many eyes make light work. In graphic design we are trying to find the best visual solutions -- but how often do we throw out partially formed ideas and see if anyone can poke holes (or find pain points we didn't plan on) early in the process? This can be done within a classroom or studio between colleagues -- as things come together make sure you're passing things around between desks/desktops -- or it can take place out in the world at large (via something like Dribbble? Github? Behance?).

## Not just Theory

"It is absurdly arrogant to begin the design process with an empty piece of paper"[^]- Hella Jongerius & Louise Schouwenberg (<https://www.readingdesign.org/beyond-the-new>)

What Raymond is describing in _TCATB_ is actually not anything novel. There are other structures that enable cultural creation via means that are distributed, include "bug fixes" from the community, and shared and forked: vernacular design. What is described by Raymond, and what has been adopted by F/LOS communities is really not so different from the way that most human creations came to be.

In _How Buildings Learn_, Stewart Brand dissects vernacular building and describes a process that predates the Linux community, yet sounds uncannily similar. In Brand's view, the vernacular process is a systematic framework for evolving concepts. A culture steadily culminates frameworks over time. Vernacular designers reuse the invented forms and methods for common, everyday tasks. Contemporary design typically looks for new or unique solution to a given problem, which is counter-productive to creating traditions.

Vernacular in this context means common designs by common people. Common features survive the passage of time when they are generally understood as "good." Over years, the vernacular incorporates more and more "good" features while eradicating "bad" ones.

To illustrate this in _HBL_, Brand references the Cape Cod house. He includes a wonderful diagram called "The Evolution Chart of the Siasconset Whale House," which visualizes what Raymond is trying to explain to us in _TCATB_ (and that Braithwaite also wants contemporary designers to get), that simple things released into the wild of a user community will grow, evolve, and change -- and will come back with improvements. The improvements are merged into the computer code or architectural language. Repeat. Torvalds is a genius to Raymond not because he uncovered something brand new, but in that he managed to take an existing form of cultural production and accelerate and decentralize it so as to maximize the merging of fixes and improvments and new features!

If new software can be designed and constructed this way, and vernacular cultural objects have always come to be this way, what's so hard in contemporary visual design?

## Free as in Freedom

"I consider that the Golden Rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it." -- Stallman in GNU manifesto

Richard Stallman first published the GNU Manifesto in 1985\. In it, he described "Free Software," which was in opposition to proprietary software. Stallman's motivations for this were both pragmatic and utopian. He was hoping to maintain the kind of environment that he had come to expect from computer programming: a vernacular-like model where everyone builds upon everyone else's work. Stallman also was hoping to fight against the tide of proprietary, closed softwares and tools he felt rising. Free software is predecated on the following freedoms:

```
A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

A program is free software if it gives users adequately all of these freedoms. Otherwise, it is nonfree. While we can distinguish various nonfree distribution schemes in terms of how far they fall short of being free, we consider them all equally unethical.
```

Free software, as defined by Stallman, is ethical. It has a point of view. Its clear about where it stands. Braithwaite and Raymond do not deal with this in their discussion or analysis of "Open Design" and "Open Source" respectively. Students that were attempting to get a grip on their position as a designer intentionally using design as a political or critical act found something of use here that they had not in the other readings and discussion. The software they might use could reflect their ethics.

## Opposition

The way Stallman positioned GNU was intentionally oppositional to "main stream" software. As GNU/Linux and other F/LOS tools have grown, they've mostly maintained this outside, oppositional status. Stallman was never against developers making money -- the GNU project and Free Software Foundation have always been clear that Free means Freedom, not free as in price -- but he is against developers or companies making money by sacrificing or minimizing the freedoms of their users.[gnu reference]

Software / OS as a radical act was a fresh take for the class. Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby in _Designer as Author_ propose that designers "develop a parallel design activity that questions and challenges industrial agendas."

Walking into the average design classroom or studio presents one is greeted by an aluminum wall punctuated by glowing fruit behind which everyone has the same "creative cloud" raining down similar outputs from (mostly) the same sets of aesthetic inputs. By replacing one's computer and software suite with F/LOSS alternatives a designer immediately engages in Stallman's AND Dunne & Raby's critical activities. Designer's can better access the transparency Braithwaite talks about and better actualize the sort of vernacular un-self-concious iterating, improving, and forking; as well as provide a critique of our current situation by embodying alternative social and technical values.[D&R]

## Free doesn't mean easy

So we have on one hand a pragmatic approach that is based in the history of designing, the history of just how we as humans created cultural and societal artifacts, and on the other a critical design approach that intentionally positions itself as different from mainstream capitalism.

By choosing openness, transparency, and sharing designers are working in a way that is at odds w/ what the market wants. If you see design as serving business, then making your designs available to everyone might not seem like the right approach (Stallman has a rebuttal to this kind of thinking, but its a barrier).

Another obstacle is that while you might be adopting more open practices for yourself and are being more open to collaboration, you are actually less able to collaborate as you no longer use the tools of your peers. In our class we collaborated with MICA's library on some new materials. The library thinks of itself as an open entity within the school -- the ideals of Stallman's and F/LOS at large are mirrored by the Library's director and staff. However, there were limitations to what we could do -- we still had to create everything with creative cloud for example. We were able to collect and share all manner of our designs, but we couldn't ever include the typefaces in our repositories as they also aren't open (the Library adheres to MICA's brand guidelines for its materials).

That F/LOS tools are hard to install and/or hard to use commonly is cited at the main barrier to use. Every student at least once this term came in frustrated with not being able to do something or get a feature to work, etc. with some application being used.

## Forks in the Road

"We need utopian thinking because without it, we are constrained by the tyranny of the possible." -- Stephen Duncombe [Open Fields....]

F/LOS ideals create an oppositional model useful for critiquing our mainstream culture. By choosing to use this surreal set of softwares (Linux, Scribus, etc.) a designer is specifically saying "I am not using the same computer or software as you." and "my computer software has different ethics than yours" This has use as a critique of the status quo.

What do you see out there when you look for open source design? Fonts, Icons, Templates, Frameworks. Is this what F/LOS design means? Is that all that's possible? We should start to see chances for design as a social critique; design that can return to its vernacular roots and not just serve clients or business.

As a course, Special Topics in Graphic Design: Open Source was half seminar and half studio. What the course was most useful for to me was remembering that the way that Open Source software works is not unique to contemporary startup culture -- the things we need as humans have been being made in these ways forever. This means that we as visual designers are not precluded from accessing the techniques and ideas.

As an educator my role is to help create new knowledge for my discipline. F/LOS allows for this in pragmatic and utopian ways. Its pragmatic in that there are F/LOS tools that do not exist in main stream operating systems nor from Adobe or Autodesk (the Spiro tool in InkScape for example, or NodeBox or Processing). It is utopian in that the tools themselves can reflect non-traditional values and propose alternate fictions or expand what is understood as possible or "standard."

Another pedagogical advantage to F/LOS is that the file types are open standards. This means files can easily be tracked and shared with tools that make a workflow of collaborating, sharing, etc. easy. It also relinquishes one from the tyranny of tools. One can focus on designing over application learning.
